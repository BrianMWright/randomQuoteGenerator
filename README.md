# randomQuoteGenerator
 This was my first JS project submitted for peer review and grading.

In addition to meeting the passing requirements, I also implemented additional 'bonus' features that earned it a rating of "Exceeds Expectation".

Also note, I re-organized the project files as following:

index.html
assets > css & js
js > script.js
js > quotes.js
css > normalize.css
css > styles.css

I placed all of my data (the quotes) into a separate .js file "quotes.js" for maintainability. My goal was to separate out the data from the main code.
